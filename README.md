## Overview

## Height by Age Group Analysis

This project explores how height variability differs across age groups using a small synthetic dataset.
Rather than focusing only on average height, the analysis emphasizes distribution and spread.

## Dataset
The dataset contains individual records with:
- age
- height
- derived age_group (Child, Adult, Senior)

Age groups are used to compare height distributions across life stages.

## Analysis
- Heights are grouped by age category
- A box plot is used to visualize:
   - Meidan height
   - Spread of values (interquartile range)
   - Outliers within each age group

## Key Observations
- The child group shows the greatest variability in height, reflecting different growth stages
- Adult heights are more tightly clustered, indicating stabilized growth
- Seniors show moderate variability, possibly influenced by age-related height changes

## Purpose
This project demonstrates how box plots can reveal variability and distribution patterns that are not visible when using averages alone.

## Tools
- Python
- pandas
- matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook
